- 👋 Hi, I’m Cristina (born and raised overseas)
- 👀 I’m interested in a variety of things: food, health, microbiology, educational facts, politics, technology, agriculture, farming, animals (hourses are my favourite)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do my job properly without conscious bias (I prefer training myself when there is nothing else available - hard to find good mgmt support these days)
- 💞️ I’m looking to better myself, I prefer working in a team, so collaborating is important to me even if it is work related or not. You can see that I am easy to talk to, and I love simplifying things in general because I think there are others that need to grasp the idea also.  
- 📫 You can reach me by this email: cristina.rosu@forces.gc.ca   please - once we agreed when to meet each other I can hop onto MS Teams for chat/talk. 
I am often either in Ottawa or in Montreal (I love remote work bc of its flexibility)
